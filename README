// To build
% make

// I made a directory with test files in them so I would compile my test with
% make -C tests clean && make -C tests

// Then run my tests with 
% LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./tests/<testname>

/* This project had a lot of segfaults and bad pointers. 
    I fixed my bad exit and now the thread exit correctly.
    I still hang on test and hope to get it fixed on my own time.
    UPDATE I got it to not hang for 13. I was assuming rotation
    and the schdel would re use old threds.
    I fixed this with updated exit and yield to 
    use a flag I add. I still segfault and I think test 
    18-28 still hang. Overall, I enjoyed this and
    given the time this querter I want to comeback and make it work.*/
