// To build
% make

// I made a directory with test files in them so I would compile my test with
% make -C tests clean && make -C tests

// Then run my tests with 
% LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./tests/<testname>

/* This project had a lot of segfaults and bad pointers. 
    I fixed my bad exit and now the thread exit correctly.
    I still hand on test and hope to get it fixed on my own time.*/
